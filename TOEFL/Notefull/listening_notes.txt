Listening notes:

-	2nd section after reading.
-	While the instructions are read out for the section, take a break and deep breath.


Structure:
---------
	
	- 2 conversations and 3 lectures.
	- 1 conv, 1 or 2 lectures per set.
	- 2 or 3 sets per the listening section...
	
	- Each conversation: 5 questions
	- Each lecture: 6 questions.
	
	
Types of questions:
------------------

	- Main idea. 		- Have a sense of overall listening 
	- Detail questions. - identify which could be asked as details
	- Inference quest.	- 
	- Tone of voice. 	- 
	
	
Answering strategy for any section:
-----------------------------------

1. Read the question 100% with care for each word.
2. Prephrase the answer:
	- Check or confirm using notes or from the passage sentence if needed.
3. POE:
	- Yes/No/Maybe.
	- After two rounds of steps 1, 2, 3 -> check if you're missing anything.
	- Then do a better or worse on the remaining options.
	
4. If you don't have the proper answer or have anything other than single YES:
	- Read the q, think, check notes again, prephrase again -> then move to answer choices.
	- If your prephrased answer doesn't make sense: Re think the the notes to preprashe again.
	
	
Note taking:
-----------

1. ** Notice the subjects and objects for note taking / key word identification..
2. Understand first then take notes.
3. 

Conversation:
------------

	- Casual language.
	- Easy to follow.
	

Lecture:
-------

	- Hard to follow because of the academic nature of the topic.
	- details are repeated, not stated only once, so you can concentrate on current sentence.
	- Let go of something you missed... 
		- Maybe TOEFL repeats the sentence again.
		- If not, don't adhere to the lost sentence, focus on the current sentence and try to comprehend the whole thing, if possible.
		
	- Take more notes to cover details::	
		- Example note taking in the same folder>>

Question types:

Basic Comprehension:
	1. Gist-Content: (what) Overall content, not minor points..
	2. Gist-Purpose: (why) Student has a problem, student visits professor for ..., etc
			- Purpose and Content can be different. Student goes to ask for attendance, then they completely talk about exams.
				- Content: Exam
				- Purpose: Attendance.
	3. Detail: 
			- Still not very minor details; backgroud, support or example points are asked, if not sure choose answer that relates more to the point of the passage.
			- Always look out for new terminology, there will be a question.
			- Notes better contain everything, as identifying what point can be important at that point in time is difficult.
	
Pragmatic Understanding:
	4. Function of what is said: 
			- what some statement means in the given context, not standing alone.
	5. Speaker's attitude: Level of certainty or irony
			- irony: true meaning is opposite of the meaning in the context. "Another meeting? That's just great!"
			- degree of certainty: 	personal opinion or referring a source
									is the fact disputed or generally accepted
Connecting information:
	6. Understanding organization: 
			- orgzn of sth; topic shift, main topic - sub topic, listing down some ideas, intro, conclude, example, digress, joke etc.
			- pay attention to comparisons or overall organization of the components/ideas/theories...
	7. Connecting content:  
			- comparisons, cause and effects, contradict and agreement, classify**
			- notes should clearly contain specific terms or steps involved, classes or distinctions to ease the process of connection.
	8. Making inferences:
			- Inference based only on the content given in the lecture/convo.
