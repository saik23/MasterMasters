4th section:

 - Take a deep breath - last section.
 
 - Human and computer raters.
 - Human: content
 - Computer:  **Key words, **Linking words, format.
 
 For a full 30/30: 
 
Q1: 
	- Passage (280 words - 3/4 paragraphs) with a title.
	- Lecture (2 minutes)
	- How does lecture oppose the passage.
	
	Reading:
	--------
		- 1st paragraph: 30 seconds.
		- 2nd, 3rd, 4th - 50 seconds each.
		- Comprehension over note taking...
			- Last parts of the first paragraph (Background, setup, then the point)
			- Beginning parts of the rest of the paragraphs..
			
		- Take notes
					Read 		|  		Listen
					---------------------------
					1.			|		1.
					2.			|		2.
					3. 			|		3.
					4.			|		4.
			- Comprehension first notes later. Read, understand then take notes..
			
	Approach:
	--------
		- Certainty vs Plausibility
			- If the passage or the reading says, 
				- something is certain, then match that tone in writing - say that with certainty.
				- somethign is plausible, then match that particular tone: say that with a sense of plausibility and not with certainty..
					- This is for the perfect 5.
					
		- Trim the fat:
			- Pronouns are better if avoided.
			- No extra words or sentences needed. Write carefully **.
			
		- Repeat:
			- Write two or three times, not just once.
			
		- Structure:
			P1: introduce author's claim, state how the professor opposes/agrees with it, state professor's claim.
			P2: author's reason, what prof thinks of it and prof's argument for opposition - (state prof's opinion on first point).
			P3: same for 2nd point.
			P4: same for 3rd point.
			(P5): Use all the concluding sentences in each passage here instead of the last line of each paragraph.
			
		- No more use of SO -> computer and academic writing doesn't regard "so".
			- Use consequently or as a result, instead..

Q1. Integrated reading and listening then writing:

	1. How to read:
		- Brief notes on the main idea for the passage from Paragraph 1.
		- Notice the organization of the passage:
			- Argument or explanation to support or strengthen the main cause of the passage.
			- Argument or explanation to support or weaken the main cause of the passage.
		- Each key point from the next 3 or 4 paragraphs.
		
	2. How to listen.
		- Pay attention to lecture's attitude towards the reading: supporting or contradicting..
		- Identify the points mentioned in reading and the stand presented in the lecture.
		** Each point is important.
		
	3. How to write:
		- Give brief intro to what is stated in reading and how lecture stands on it.
		- Keep your opinions at bay. Refer only to the content from the reading and lecture.
		- Each point from reading and how it links with lecture in subsequent paragraphs.
		** Each point is important.
		
Q2. Independent:

	1. What's the big deal:
		- Quality of ideas and the way the argument is developed first, number of ideas second.
		- Here you give your opinion.
		- Don't write just to write. Refer to 1.
		
	2. Development:
		- How well the argument is supported with examples or details.
		- How many specific details or examples are given to develop the essay are important, in that order.
		- Choose words to write carefully, lengthy introductions and conclusions repeating something or not involving a key idea are not good.
		- Don't mention anything that looks to the reader like it is memorized. Never mention any surveys.
		- Write to express an idea not just empty words that dont carry any significance..
		
	3. Organization:
		- Each point in the passage should more or less be connected to the main idea(unity). Merely using Firstly, Secondly doesn't gaurantee that.
		- Maintain unity. Avoid: redundancy, digression, unclear connections.
		- Write for the reader: Easily flowing from start to end; connected.
	
	4. Language use:
		-  If language is hard to follow, sentences are very basic and simple, vocabulary is limited: MAX score ~ 3, even with impressive ideas.

	For both essays this is how you write it:::

		1. Plan and details.
		2. First draft -> with emphasis on the thesis and main points.
		3. Review with main point development as key focus and proof read along with it.
		4. Proofread if possible..

Other tips to write better essays:
=================================
** Summary:
	- intro that captivates
	- thesis line or two, that captures the whole passage's essence.
	- main ideas (3), each with a topic sentence that captures the paragraph's main point, can also serve as a transition.
	- sub idea: an analogy, personal experience, conceding shortcomings from a different perspective or something which adds more light to the main point.
	- conclusion: no new ideas, reiterate points in new words, leave the readers with something to think about.
	
1. Introductions:
	- It should titillate the reader to finish the essay **
	- Ways to do this:
		"FORESHADOW":
		1. Start with a question or "BACKGROUND" leading to the main point.
		2. Start with a narrative or quotation.
		3. Begin with a shocking statement/question or dramatic facts/statistics.

2. Thesis / the point of the passage:
	- It should give the specific important point(s) of the passage in the single line or two.
	- It shouldn't just be a fact/observation, should contain opinion.
	
	- MAKING SURE YOU EXPLAIN THE THESIS FOR THE READER. Define the term from your perspective, how you will write about it.
		- Specific words that need to be defined clearly (in what sense you mean to write about them) should be clearly defined before presenting the thesis.
	
	- Main ideas supporting the thesis:
		- These add strenght, explain in detail or support using background info to the thesis.
		- Can vary from 3 or more.
		- How to get to the main ideas:
			1. Who? 
			2. What? if?
			3. When?
			4. Where?
			5. Why? not?
			6. How? much?
			7. THINK ABOUT THE ORGAINZATION OF THE PASSAGE:
				- main cause for a problem -> (main ideas) effects of the problem.
				- general / abstract idea -> (main ideas) specific details.
				- compare / contrast (each distinction -> main idea).
		
3. Main Ideas:

	- Topic sentence - gist of the main idea for the paragraph.
		- Each main idea should be developed fully, that is it should be completely explained.
		- Topic sentences can be used to do the transition from one idea to another.
		
	- Arranging the ideas in order:
		- Order of importance.. least important first or most important first.
		- Chronological order.
	
4. Supporting ideas:
	
	- Analogies that relate better
	- Stories, facts or statistics that give a clear picture
	- Opposite point of view to concede some shortcomings.
	
5. Transitions:

	- transition from (connect) one idea to another appropriately. Before moving on to the new point.
	- choose transitional words based on the relation:
		- Similar or Contrasting ideas?
		- Further explanation/ clarification?
		- Concluding or continuing...
	
6. Conclusion:

	- It should reiterate the thesis in new words.
	- Tell about the importance of the ideas presented.
	
	- Tips to include in conclusion:
		- leave with a question for the reader to think about.
		- Provide a suggestion or prediction based on the ideas/thesis.
		- Other than summarizing the main ideas.
		- Conclude the ideas with a personal story to highlight all the main ideas....
		
7. The art of writing:
	- Plan, draft, write, revise, edit, proof-read.
	- Revise:
		- check the draft exactly tells what you wanted to tells
		- check the organization of the passage, the thesis and main ideas are what you want them to be.
		
	- Editing:
		- Check the grammar and language use (synonyms etc.)
		
	- Proof-read:
		- Check for spelling errors and typos.
