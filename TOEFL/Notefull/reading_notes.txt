Mistakes:

1. Read the question with utmost care										x1
	- especially in case of paraphrase type questions
	
2. Inference type - infer what you can only from the passage/paragraph 		x3
	- don't try to draw inferences from memory or imagination, stick to 2, 3 lines before or after the line in question.
	- it shouldn't oppose the main idea of the passage.
	- You should be able to point to a line in the passage for proof.
	
3. Better strategy:															x1
	- Skim the passage then identify key points, passage point and move on to questions.		

4. Insert a sentence														x1
	- Check if the given sentence introduces a concept and is detailed later. Intro first -> detail next..
	- The sentence has to have something in common with the previous one and the later one.
