Review of questions:

1. Give an opinion:
	- State your answer, reason behind your thought, explain or elaborate with an example or personal view.

2. (Integrated):
	- Fundamental Connections: Connection words to link the two views presented, either both agree or disagree, clearly articulate the linking words to make the listener easily understand that you have actually grasped the whole concept, instead of just spitting out details from the content.
	
	- Fundamental Speaking Clearly: Read with intonations, words grouped to emphasise your understanding, pauses and breaks between different contexts..
