Grammar Notes:
=============

0. Other random stuff:
	- consider sth. sth. and not consider sth. to be sth. or consider sth. as sth.
	
1. Infintives (Verbal - a verb that functions as adj, adv or a noun):
	- verbs in the present tense form for a subject expressing the reason behind some actions are considered as infinitives.
		Eg: I like (to read).
			I use Youtube (to watch) stuff. 	- Noun
			He's the guy (to call). 			- Adjective.
			I can't wait (to see).				- Adverb
	- Infintives are made of verbs but don't form verbs, instead they are adj, noun or adv.
	
	
	- Bare infinitives: they do not have a "to" before the verb:
		- I heard the dorbell (ring).
		- They watched the ship (sail).
		
	- Split infinitive (frowned upon in formal written english).
		- They decided (to carefully evaluate) each student's performance.
			Other ways to say this, which doesn't make much sense:
			- They decided carefully (to evaluate) each student's performance.
			- They decided (to evaluate) carefully each student's performance.
		
2. Other verbals:
	- Gerund: With an ing before the verb acting as a Noun.
		- (Laughing) is good for health.
		- I love (listening).
		
	- Participles: They act as adjectives.
		- (Shooting) stars.
		- (Burnt) marshmellows are my favourite.
		
		
3. Subordinating clauses:
	- When the subordinating clause starts with a relative pronoun such as who, whose, where, which, etc., the use of comma depends on the nature of clause. In writing, there are two patterns that use subordinating conjunctions:

	- If the information provided in the relative clause is essential, we do not use a comma before the conjunction, in this way:
			Main clause + Essential relative clause
	- If the information provided in the relative clause is nonessential, we use a comma before the conjunction, in this way:
			Main clause + , + Nonessential relative clause
	- Further, we also use a comma when the dependent clause is placed first, in order to separate the two clauses. However, if the independent clause comes first, no comma is placed.
	
4. Nouns:

	- Uncountable:
		- Treated as singular.
		- advice, information, news, furniture, luggage, health, justice, fun
		
	- Countable and uncountable:
		- hair, paper, room, noise, time..
		
5. Verbs:
	- Auxiliary verbs - is, be, will, shall, could
	- Modals - will, shall, might, could  - used for permission, ability, necessity
	- Infintives
	- Sub verb agreement:
		- set of subjects - are
		- group - is
	
6. Pronouns:
	- Indefinite pronouns:
		- Singular - each, one, none, either, everyone, everybody, nobody, anything, somethig, someone -- always singular.
			Execption - Everyone must buy their own ticket.
		- Plural - both, many etc.
			
		- Both: all, any, more, most, none, some...
			Most of time is spent doing situps.
			Most of the students were absent.
			
	- Possessive pronouns:
		- Its not it's
		- Jack and Jill's pot (combined possesions)
		- Jacks's and Jill's plates were shattered. (Individual possesion)
	
7. Prepositions:
	- into
	- Shows relationship of noun with sth else in terms of place, time and action in the sentence.
	
8. Adjectives:
	- Paired adjectives:
		- If they come after noun use and:
			She went to the movie and says it was fabulous and enthralling.
		- If they come before the noun:
			- If they carry same meaning use a comma:
				- She ate tasty, delicious food.
			- If they carry different meaning no need of comma:
				- She ate tasty indian dal rice.

Style Notes:
============

1. Word repetition:
	- Try to use synonyms or pronouns or words like former, latter, etc., to eliminate excess repetition.
	
2. Passive sentence:
	- Passive sentences are long and hard (that's what she said) to read. Think judiciously before using them.
	- Should be limited to 5% of the whole text.
	
	- When the action is more important the actor:
		- The theater was opened last month. (Theater opening is more imp than who opened it)
	- When the receiver of the action is more imp than the actor:
		- The letters were faxed this morning. (Letters > person who sent).
		
	--- Basically when you want to sound objective, pay more attention to anything other than the subject -> PASSIVE..
	
3. Long Short:
	- Long sentence and short sentence mixture -> Try to break a sentence if it's too long, and in combination with other long ones, to two short sentences.
	
4. Beginning with coordinating conjunctions:
	- So I started writing this and realised it's a mistake.
	- Try to avoid starting too many sentences with coordinating conjunctions.
